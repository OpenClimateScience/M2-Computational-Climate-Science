M2: Computational Climate Science
=================================

> How can we analyze gridded climate datasets with spatial and temporal attributes? How is climate variability measured and modeled?

The second module of our [open climate-science curriculum](https://openclimatescience.github.io/curriculum) focuses on preparing learners to work with gridded climate datasets.
**At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

- Describe the interpretation and calculation of climate normals, climate anomalies, and a climatology.
- Learn what indices are available for meteorological drought, soil moisture drought, atmospheric water demand, and canopy greenness.
- Calculate a drought index.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

- Uses meaningful but brief filenames and folder names. Uses one of the following strategies: Timestamps, Process hierarchy, or Filename metadata. (CC1.3)
- Uses a package manager to install and manage software dependencies. (CC1.10)
- Knows how to navigate a file system using both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI). (CC1.4)
- Records relationships between code, results, and metadata. (CC1.5)
- Understands machine representations of numeric data types. (CC2.1)
- Can debug a computational workflow, either by deduction, print statements, breakpoints, or an interactive debugger. (CC2.7)
