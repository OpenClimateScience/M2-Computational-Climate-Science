    "In the previous lesson, we used `dask` and `xarray` to read a collection of netCDF files, then **mapped** a **vectorized function** over each array in a time series. We produced a graph that showed the Precipitation-to-PET ratio for Tiaret, Algeria, in the early months of 2024, during a severe drought.\n",
    "\n",
    "On its own, the graph doesn't tell us how severe the drought in Tiaret is. Although precipitation in the region has replenished less than 5% of its lost water over the past few months, this could just be part of the normal seasonal cycle. Actually, we know that January through April is a relatively wet period for Tiaret, but the question remains: **Can we compare this year to past years?**\n",
